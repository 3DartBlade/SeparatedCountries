# SeparatedCountries
Contains separated 4k images of 195 countries + Antarctica that can be put on a sphere and should perfectly be in their place. Also contains a .xcf file which can be opened using GIMP and contains the countries on separate layers.  Please note that colonies of countries are on the same image as their parent countries *(for example Greenland is part of the "Kingdom of Denmark" so it is on the same image as Denmark.[also Greenland is officially an autonomous country, but the source I have been using did not list Greenland as a country. Sorry about that])* Feel free to further separate these.  Works well in pair with the Planet Earth Free asset.
