# SeparatedCountries
Contains separated 4k images of 195 countries + Antarctica that can be put on a sphere and should perfectly be in their place. Also contains a .xcf file which can be opened using [**GIMP**](https://www.gimp.org) and contains the countries on separate layers.  Please note that colonies of countries are on the same image as their parent countries *(for example Greenland is part of the "Kingdom of Denmark" so it is on the same image as Denmark.(also Greenland is officially an autonomous country, but the [source](https://www.worldometers.info/geography/alphabetical-list-of-countries/) I have been using did not list Greenland as a country. Sorry about that))* Feel free to further separate these.  Works well in pair with the [**Planet Earth Free**](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/sci-fi/planet-earth-free-23399) Unity asset.
